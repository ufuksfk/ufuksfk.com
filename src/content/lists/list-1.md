## Bill Gates

I am not sure If Bill Gates is evil or not, but one thing for sure is either as a full marketing philantropy or just concerning about world problems, he’s one of the few minds that have truly shaped this century, and he’s still trying to influence its direction. And I personally believe he might have a lot of secret agenda but he is really nice guy.

## Tony Fadell

He is father of iPod. One of the good guys from Silicon Valley that I am trying to follow whatever he says. I read his book Build, which became one of my all-time favorites for its honesty and hands-on wisdom about product design and leadership.

## Balaji Srinivasan

A techno-optimist and one of the most provocative thinkers in crypto and network governance. Even if I don’t agree with everything he says, his ideas about decentralized societies are worth reading.

## Hannah Richie

A data-driven environmental scientist whose work at Our World in Data brings clarity to complex global problems. I like how she challenges pessimism with facts, showing how progress and sustainability can coexist.

## Scott Galloway

A professor and entrepreneur who mixes sharp analysis with brutal honesty about business, tech, and society. His take on masculinity, capitalism, and education often hits hard but feels necessary. He might be one of my idols actually.

## Cal Newport

The voice of focus in the age of distraction. His ideas on deep work, digital minimalism, and meaningful productivity constantly remind me that doing less—but better—is often the smartest way to move forward.

## Benedict Evans

One of the best at explaining where technology is headed. His essays and newsletters break down big shifts in the tech industry with clarity, giving both strategic and historical context that’s rare today.
