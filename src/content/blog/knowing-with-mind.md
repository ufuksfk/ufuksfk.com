## 1. The Limits of Reason

Let’s say you are an intelligent person. You understand some things just by reasoning.  
But you have no experiment, no historical evidence, and no public agreement on the topic.  
Still, you believe you found the truth — because you trust your mind.

But is that a mistake?  
The scientific method tells us _“don’t trust only your mind.”_  
Because without evidence, belief can easily turn into illusion.  
On the other hand, how could the world move forward without the human mind?

## 2. A Personal Example

Let me explain this dilemma with an example from my own life.

Since my youth, I’ve been trying to perform _namaz_, the main prayer of Islam.  
I can’t say I’m very consistent these days, but I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what it means, why we do it, and what kind of benefits it brings to this world.  
I’ve also noticed the rituals in other religions. I knew that fasting, praying, and repetitive physical postures exist in many beliefs.

## 3. The Realization

But this year, while reading about yoga practice and Buddhism, I finally realized a truth that was in front of my eyes for years.

**Yoga and namaz are the same thing.**

Of course, not exactly the same — but they are very similar, especially in their _worldly benefits_.  
Both are a form of exercise.  
All the postures in namaz — bowing, prostration, sitting — already exist in yoga.  
Yoga even has a much wider library of movements.  
One comes from a 5,000-year-old culture; the other from a 1,500-year-old religion.

> Historically, _salat_ (Islamic prayer) developed its physical form gradually.  
> Early sources describe standing, bowing, and prostration as symbols of submission to God [<a href="#ref1">1</a>].  
> Early yoga texts mention _āsana_ simply as a “seated posture” for meditation, and only centuries later it evolved into the wide range of postures we know today [<a href="#ref2">2</a>].  
> So while the resemblance between _namaz_ and yoga is clear, their roots belong to different cultural and historical contexts [<a href="#ref3">3</a>].

With my own reasoning, I concluded that these two practices must share the same roots.  
I’m almost sure about it.  
Somehow, in human history, these exercises, mindfulness practices, and “body–mind balance” ideas have all mixed together.

## 4. Etymology and Historical Roots

### Namaz

The term **“namāz”** (Persian: نماز) is derived from Middle Persian _namāž_, meaning “reverence, worship” [<a href="#ref4">4</a>].  
It traces back to the Proto-Indo-Iranian root _námas-_, meaning “to bow or show respect” [<a href="#ref5">5</a>].  
This same root also appears in Sanskrit as **“namas”**, which we see today in the greeting **“namaste”** — _namas_ (“bow, reverence”) + _te_ (“to you”) — literally “I bow to you” [<a href="#ref6">6</a>].  
So both _namaz_ and _namaste_ carry the shared theme of humility and respect expressed through physical bowing.

### Ṣalāt

The Qur’anic term **“ṣalāt”** (صلاة), used for the Islamic prayer, comes from the triliteral Arabic root _ṣ-l-w_, associated with meanings like “to connect”, “to link”, or “to draw near” [<a href="#ref7">7</a>].  
Some scholars link it to the Aramaic/Syriac word _ṣelôṯā_ (ܨܠܘܬܐ), meaning “to bend or pray” [<a href="#ref8">8</a>].  
In the Qur’an, _ṣalāt_ appears over 80 times, referring broadly to devotion or spiritual connection rather than the structured ritual we know today [<a href="#ref9">9</a>].  
Over time, that sense of inner connection evolved into a physical and organized act of worship.

### Yoga

The word **“yoga”** comes from the Sanskrit root _yuj_ (युज्), meaning “to join, unite, or yoke” [<a href="#ref10">10</a>].  
It shares its linguistic ancestry with the English word **“yoke”**, both descending from the Proto-Indo-European root _yeug-_, meaning “to join or connect” [<a href="#ref11">11</a>].  
This etymology beautifully mirrors yoga’s philosophical aim: uniting body, mind, and spirit.

### English Words

Even in English, certain words echo the same cultural idea of connection through practice.  
The word **“practice”** comes from Greek _praktikos_ (“to do”), and **“ritual”** from Latin _ritus_ (“religious observance”).  
Both point to repetition, action, and devotion — reminding us that faith, like movement, becomes meaningful only when practiced.

# 5. When Belief Meets Research

But if I wanted to _prove_ this idea?  
I could read blogs, watch YouTube videos, or even study historical sources:  
How did the concept of _salat_ enter Islam?  
When did _namaz_ take its current form?  
Was there any Sanskrit influence?  
These are questions that could take years of research.

But most of us don’t have that much time.  
And people who do usually interpret things through their own worldview.  
Logically, many smart Islamic scholars must have noticed this similarity too.  
But when I was religious, I never heard anyone talk about it.

# 6. Finding Truth

And here we arrive at the main question:  
**Can a person find the truth only by using their mind?**

I think sometimes yes. But it’s not the final step — it’s just the beginning.  
The mind leads us to an idea.  
But to confirm it, we need research, comparison, and observation.  
The mind points the direction, but to reach the truth, we still have to walk the path.
