in plain english, I am writing "Hello World" to salute my old programming days.

I am going to publish occasional blog post about my personal and professional life here.

But If you can follow me via my [blog website](https://ufuksnotes.com/) or other platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@ufuksfk) or [Substack](https://substack.com/@ufuksfk), I already started writing some blog posts mostly related to what I learned those days.
