## Project Overview:

When I joined ICT Additude, all the embedded team had a mission to do something together. It was mainly to know each other well. I didn't do much technical contribution but I would like to keep it here as a good memoir.

We learned a lot about open source and industrial plan moisture sensor devices by comparing them. We learned how capacitive and resistive moisture sensing works, choose a good MCU with BLE and Wi-fi capability (ESP32-S3), come up with a basic LDO and li-po charger. We designed and produced first prototype and designed second iteration as well.

It was real fun to work with these people, but we couldn't get the real project for that team.
