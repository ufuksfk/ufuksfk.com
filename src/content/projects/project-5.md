**Project Overview:**  
**Defter Arkası** is a nonprofit social initiative that encourages young people (under 18) to write and publish thoughtful, well-crafted essays — proving that great writing isn’t limited by age.

It was originally my brother’s project, aimed at building a community of well-educated young writers. I supported the initiative however I could, mostly as a mentor and behind-the-scenes helper.
