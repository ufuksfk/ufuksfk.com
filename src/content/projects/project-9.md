**Project Overview:**  
I was 19, still the same kind of person — imagining a better future and trying to build toward it.  
I didn’t exactly succeed in changing the world back then, but I’m still proud of those early attempts.

We explored how piezoelectricity could be used in everyday products or public spaces. Most of it stayed at the mockup stage, but it sparked a lot of ideas and curiosity.
