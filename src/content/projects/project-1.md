**Project Overview:**

We developed a breath analyser device for consumer use. It can sense lots of gas at breath. With these data points, we were developing algorithms that give information about your health and your metabolism.

I resigned from our lovely startup after being a father. It was very nice to work with these people, but after being a parent I started to question my personal financial status and decided to take a break from entrepreneurship journey.

## Team

In my 3rd entrepreneurship attempt, we were 3 co-founders.

### Ufuk Safak - Technical Co-founder

I was responsible for prototyping, firmware development, hardware design, and any kind of technical details.

### Yunus Konmaz - Business Manager, Co-founder

Yunus was responsible for marketing and business management. He is the one who came up with this idea.

### Gokcen Garipoglu - Science Advisor, Co-founder

Gokcen was responsible for scientific relations and clinical trials as well as being a nutritional expert on the team. She is also a full-time lecturer in Bahcesehir University, Nutrition and Dietetics program.

## Timeline

### Alpha product

We started to work alpha phase device (A complete device with plastic, circuit, and firmware) in the **second quarter of 2021.**

We tried lots of gas sensors in that period. After intense work on gas sensors and detecting algorithms, we ended up with 2 gas sensors and used those within the alpha device.

Approximately **150** people used this early version device without paying any money.

In **Big Bang Start-up Challenge 2020 of ituseed (Nov,2020),** we raised approximately 30k$ prize and started working on avokadio as a full-time

### Beta product

We updated our alpha product with a new design, new dimensions, and without a screen. This version only works with a Bluetooth connection and customers have to use our mobile application to interact with the device.

This device has a plastic enclosure with mold production. We also design a mold and produce it in 1k pieces.

Firmware and measurement algorithm was also upgraded.

We start working on product updates in **Jul 2021**.

Mold design was finished in **Sep 2021.**

Plastics were produced with mold production in 1k pieces in **Oct 2021**.

Circuit design was finished just after mold production had finished.

We were ready to go **CES 2022** with the product in **Nov 2021.**
