## Project Overview:

This was my first role in Sweden — working as a subconsultant at **OIM Sweden**.  
We were supporting a life science startup, [Arrowlake](https://arrowlake.se/), by contributing to the design of their power supply system — specifically focusing on **5kW Power Factor Correction (PFC)**.

I couldn't finish the project completely. We designed and produced first iteration (which was huge PCB) and it worked up to 4 kW. While we were keep working on it, I decided to jump to another company :(

It was one of the greatest environment I have been. I think I am very lucky to start my professional life in Sweden at OIM Sweden.
