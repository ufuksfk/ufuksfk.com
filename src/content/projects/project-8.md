**Project Overview:**  
I consulted for **Sigma Connectivity**, a global tech house, as an Electronics Engineer. The work focused on an internal **Medtech and Consumer Electronics** project, using state-of-the-art chipsets for a market-leading client.

Unfortunately, I can’t share more details due to NDA — but it was one of those projects that pushed both design and engineering to the edge.
