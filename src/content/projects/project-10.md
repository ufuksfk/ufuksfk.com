**Project Overview:**  
A high school project from 2008 focused on the issue of global warming. We researched and identified a material with high thermal insulation properties and proposed lining the inner walls of bread ovens with it to better retain heat. The idea was to improve energy efficiency by reducing heat loss. The project made it to the finals in a student competition organized by TÜBİTAK.
