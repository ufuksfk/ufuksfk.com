**Project Overview:**
I had been working as an Embedded System Engineer for almost 18 months in ABE Teknoloji, located in Istanbul.

When I started, the company had an FM Radio Retransmission System, already installed in 5 highway tunnels. With me and our team, we upgraded this device into a more industrial and compact form factor. We worked on the software, hardware, industrial design, and GUI.

The device is simply getting an on-air FM signal and retransmitting it into the tunnel. It can also interfere with the signal and broadcast live and recorded announcements. It can work up to 64 channels and can be a transmitter, receiver, or transceiver thanks to its modular design.

## Key Outcomes

1. Create a visually stunning and user-friendly device that fits to industry standards (3U rack cabinet unit)
2. Backend structure is moved from stationary computer to industrial SBC inside of device.
3. All circuit designs and general system design is restructured to be as modular as possible.

## Technology Stack

- **Chipsets:** MSP430, SiTime SI4721, Odroid SBC
- **Industrial GUI:** Python, Flask, Bootstrap 4, Embedded Linux
- **Hardware Design:** Circuit Studio
