## Project Overview:

I worked as an **Embedded Systems Engineer** at **ABE Teknoloji** in Istanbul for nearly 18 months.

At the time, the company had an FM Radio Retransmission System already deployed in 5 highway tunnels. Together with the team, we redesigned and upgraded the system into a more **compact, industrial-grade form factor**. Our work spanned software, hardware, industrial design, and GUI development.

The device receives on-air FM signals and retransmits them into tunnels using **leaky feeder coaxial antennas** (already installed for communication coverage). It also allows **live or recorded voice announcements** to override the signal when needed. Thanks to its **modular architecture**, the system can operate across **up to 64 channels** and be configured as a **transmitter, receiver, or full transceiver**.

## ‚úÖ Key Outcomes

1. Designed a compact, visually refined 3U rack-mountable device that meets industrial standards
2. Migrated the backend from a stationary PC to an **embedded industrial SBC** inside the device
3. Restructured the circuit and system architecture to enable **full modularity**
